Technology is amazing. Modern frameworks and computing architectures are more powerful than
ever. Despite the progress, it can be quite time consuming to learn a new technology, 
especially if not done in an organized way. To be a little more thoughtful and organized
with my own professional development, I decided to start this blog where I can 
turn my random musings into more polished articles for the benefit of myself and anyone
else that finds it useful.

Shout out to all of the amazing developers around the world that share their amazing 
materials with the world! You all are an inspiration.
