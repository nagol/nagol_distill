Technology is amazing. Modern frameworks and computing architectures are more powerful than
ever. It can be quite time consuming when learning a new technology or refactoring code. 
Many times, the answers to our questions are found in helpful StackOverflow posts
or blog articles that some wonderful human put together and shared with the world.

Inspired by the amazing work of others, I wanted to make a effort to contribute
back. As a result, this blog was created.
